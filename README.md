Weaponized OSINT & Personal Cognitive Defense
This repository contains research and policy frameworks analyzing how Generative AI transforms fragmented public data into targeted cyber threats.
+1

Core Research Areas:
* Weaponized OSINT: How AI automates the aggregation of "harmless" public data to build high-fidelity target profiles.
* Psychometric Inference: The use of digital footprints to infer "Big Five" personality traits (e.g., Neuroticism, Agreeableness) for precision spear-phishing.
* The Mosaic Effect: Analysis of how AI reverses anonymization by correlating disparated datasets.
* Cognitive Defense: A proposed framework for "Human Firewalls," including Identity Segregation and Data Poisoning protocols.
